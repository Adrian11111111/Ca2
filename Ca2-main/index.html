          <h1>Overview of the project</h1>
          <p>
            As a group we set out to make a website containing everyting
            important to visual design and make it acessible, meaning no colour
            coding of spesific things without clear text to indicte what they
            do. the website is spesificly designed to be as easy as possible to
            use while looking and functioning well. We achieved this with the
            use of Flex, media queries, a well designed colour pallet and an
            easy to use side bar, directing you to each page.
          </p>

        <section class="section_box">
          <h1>Content structure</h1>
          <p>
            Our website is structured using an expandable sidebar, with links to
            all the different sites we have created. on the nav bar the sites
            will rotate, when moving to a different page,meaning the site you
            are meant to visit next will be on top but if access is need to any
            of the other pages, it is easily achieved. The use of this keeps the
            website clean as well as making it functional, this was achieved
            using a JavaScript function to animate the width when the open
            button and close buttons are pressed.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="section_box">
          <h1>Device Support</h1>
          <p>
            Through the use of media queries in both css and java script we have
            made the website accessible in both desktop environments and on
            mobile devices, as demonstrated on the flexbox site, when shrunk to
            a mobile device, the desktop picture disappears and a new, more
            mobile friendly picture appears, also the sidebar when used in
            desktop size will push the content aways from it, making it visible
            as well as the rest of the content on the page. we did this because
            there is enough space to have both visible at the same time. when
            switching to mobile, the sidebar does not change the main page
            content as the is not enough room.
